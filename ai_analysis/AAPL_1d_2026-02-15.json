Explain what supports or undermines it (volume, RSI divergence, momentum alignment).\n\n3. **Key Price Levels**: Identify the most important support and resistance levels visible on the chart. Include approximate price values.\n\n4. **Expected Move**: Based on the trend, momentum, and pattern context, what is the most probable next move? Include a target price and an invalidation level.\n\n5. **Risk Assessment**: Any warning signs or divergences that traders should watch for?\n\nBe specific with price levels and dates where visible.

    "response": "1. **Pattern Recognition**: The chart is forming a **Descending Triangle** pattern. The pattern starts from the swing high on 2025-12-03 at 288.62 and is currently in the consolidation phase, approaching the lower boundary.\n\n2. **Signal Confidence**: Confidence level: 7. The recent Turn_Down signal is supported by the RSI(9) at 22.3, indicating oversold conditions, which could lead to a short-term bounce. However, the close is below the momentum trend line, supporting the bearish signal.\n\n3. **Key Price Levels**:\n   - **Support Levels**: 243.42, 225.95\n   - **Resistance Levels**: 280.91, 288.62\n\n4. **Expected Move**: The most probable next move is a bearish continuation due to the descending triangle pattern. The target price is 243.42, with an invalidation level at 280.91.\n\n5. **Risk Assessment**: Watch for potential bullish divergence on RSI, which could indicate a reversal. The oversold RSI(9) suggests caution for short positions.",
