    "response": "1. **Pattern Recognition**:\n   - **Pattern**: Potential Double Top\n   - **Start**: The first peak around December 2025 and the second peak in February 2026.\n   - **Current Stage**: The price is declining after the second peak, indicating a possible confirmation of the pattern.\n\n2. **Signal Confidence**: \n   - **Confidence Level**: 7/10\n   - **Supporting Factors**: The recent Turn_Down signal aligns with the price being below the momentum trend line and a low RSI(9) of 22.3, indicating bearish momentum.\n   - **Undermining Factors**: The RSI(14) is not yet in oversold territory, which could limit downside potential.\n\n3. **Key Price Levels**:\n   - **Support**: Around 240, where the price previously found support in January 2026.\n   - **Resistance**: Near 270, which aligns with the recent peaks forming the potential double top.\n\n4. **Expected Move**:\n   - **Probable Move**: Further downside is likely given the bearish signal and pattern.\n   - **Target Price**: 240, aligning with the support level.\n   - **Invalidation Level**: A close above 270 would invalidate the bearish outlook.\n\n5. **Risk Assessment**:\n   - **Warning Signs**: Watch for any bullish divergence in RSI or a strong reversal candle, which could indicate a potential reversal.\n   - **Volume**: A spike in volume could signal increased selling pressure or a potential reversal if it occurs on a bullish candle.\n\nStay alert for any changes in momentum or unexpected market news that could impact the current trend."
