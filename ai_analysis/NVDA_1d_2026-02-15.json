ONLY identify patterns with straight-line boundaries that can be drawn with trendlines. If you see curved patterns (cup & handle, rounding bottom), describe them in text but note the pattern overlay cannot be drawn due to its curved nature. Describe where the pattern starts and its current stage.\n\n2. **Signal Confidence**: Rate your confidence (1-10) in the most recent trading signal. Explain what supports or undermines it (volume, RSI divergence, momentum alignment).\n\n3. **Key Price Levels**: Identify the most important support and resistance levels visible on the chart. Include approximate price values.\n\n4. **Expected Move**: Based on the trend, momentum, and pattern context, what is the most probable next move? Include a target price and an invalidation level.\n\n5. **Risk Assessment**: Any warning signs or divergences that traders should watch for?\n\nBe specific with price levels and dates where visible. Keep the analysis concise and actionable.\n\nAdditionally, at the END of your response, include a structured JSON block wrapped in ```json ... ``` code fences with this exact schema:\n```json\n{\n  \"support_levels\": [price1, price2],\n  \"resistance_levels\": [price1, price2],\n  \"direction\": \"BULLISH\",\n  \"pattern\": {\n    \"name\": \"Pattern Name\",\n    \"points\": [\n      {\"date\": \"YYYY-MM-DD\", \"price\": 123.45, \"role\": \"upper\"},\n      {\"date\": \"YYYY-MM-DD\", \"price\": 100.00, \"role\": \"lower\"}\n    ]\n  },\n  \"target_price\": 123.45,\n  \"invalidation_price\": 100.00\n}\n```\nJSON rules:\n- support_levels: 1-3 most important support prices visible on the chart\n- resistance_levels: 1-3 most important resistance prices visible on the chart\n- direction: \"BULLISH\" or \"BEARISH\" \u2014 your directional bias based on the analysis\n- pattern.name: The chart pattern identified \u2014 ONLY linear-boundary patterns that can be drawn with straight trendlines:\n  ALLOWED: Ascending Triangle, Descending Triangle, Symmetrical Triangle, Rising Wedge, Falling Wedge, Bull Flag, Bear Flag, Channel Up, Channel Down, Head & Shoulders, Inverse Head & Shoulders, Double Top, Double Bottom\n  NOT ALLOWED (set pattern to null instead): Cup & Handle, Rounding Bottom, Rounding Top, Saucer, or any pattern requiring curved lines. Describe these in the text analysis but mention the pattern overlay cannot be drawn for this pattern type due to its curved nature.\n- pattern.points: 3-6 key boundary vertices that outline the pattern shape (NOT individual price swings). Each point has:\n  - \"date\": YYYY-MM-DD format\n  - \"price\": numeric price at that vertex\n  - \"role\": either \"upper\" (upper trendline/boundary) or \"lower\" (lower trendline/boundary)\n  For channels/triangles/wedges: place 2-3 points on the upper trendline and 2-3 on the lower trendline. Upper points should form one straight line, lower points another.\n  For head & shoulders: mark the left shoulder peak, head peak, right shoulder peak (upper), and the two neckline points (lower).\n  For double top/bottom: mark the two peaks (upper) and the valley/neckline (lower), or vice versa.\n  Points should be in chronological order.\n- target_price: Your projected target price (numeric). MUST be above current close for BULLISH, below for BEARISH.\n- invalidation_price: Price level that invalidates the thesis (numeric). MUST be below current close for BULLISH, above for BEARISH.\n- All prices MUST be numeric (no strings). All dates MUST be YYYY-MM-DD format.\n- CRITICAL: For pattern points, you MUST use dates and prices ONLY from the \"Swing Highs\" and \"Swing Lows\" lists provided in the context data. Use swing highs for \"upper\" role points and swing lows for \"lower\" role points. Do NOT estimate prices from the chart image.\n- For support_levels, use prices from the Swing Lows list. For resistance_levels, use prices from the Swing Highs list.\n- If no clear pattern exists, or the pattern requires curved lines (cup & handle, rounding bottom, etc.), set pattern to null.\n- IMPORTANT: In your text response, NEVER mention \"JSON\", \"null\", \"set to null\", or any implementation details. If a pattern cannot be overlaid, simply say the pattern overlay cannot be drawn for this pattern type due to its curved nature.",
    "response": "1. **Pattern Recognition**:\n   - A **Descending Triangle** is forming, starting from the swing high on 2025-10-29 at 212.19 and using the swing lows. The lower boundary is relatively flat, while the upper boundary is descending.\n\n2. **Signal Confidence**: \n   - Confidence Level: 7\n   - The recent SHORT signal is supported by the close being below the momentum trend line and RSI levels indicating bearish momentum. However, the RSI is not in the oversold territory, which slightly undermines the signal.\n\n3. **Key Price Levels**:\n   - Support: 171.03, 169.55\n   - Resistance: 194.49, 193.63\n\n4. **Expected Move**:\n   - The most probable next move is downward, targeting a break below the support level at 171.03. The target price is 165.00, with an invalidation level at 194.49.\n\n5. **Risk Assessment**:\n   - Watch for any bullish divergence in RSI that could indicate a potential reversal. Additionally, a break above the resistance at 194.49 would invalidate the bearish outlook.",
