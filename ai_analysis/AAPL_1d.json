The price action after the peak in early February 2026 suggests a potential consolidation phase, but it does not fit a classical pattern with straight-line boundaries.\n\n2. **Signal Confidence**: \n   - **Confidence Level**: 6/10\n   - **Rationale**: The recent SHORT signal (Turn_Down) on 2026-02-12 is supported by the price being below the momentum trend line and RSI levels below 50. However, the RSI is not in oversold territory, which slightly undermines the bearish signal.\n\n3. **Key Price Levels**:\n   - **Support Levels**: 255.7, 243.42\n   - **Resistance Levels**: 280.91, 277.84\n\n4. **Expected Move**:\n   - **Direction**: BEARISH\n   - **Target Price**: 243.42 (next significant swing low)\n   - **Invalidation Level**: 280.91 (recent swing high)\n\n5. **Risk Assessment**:\n   - **Warning Signs**: Watch for any bullish divergence in RSI or a break above the momentum trend line, which could invalidate the bearish outlook.\n\n### Summary\nThe current setup suggests a bearish bias with the price below the momentum trend line and RSI levels indicating potential further downside. The target is set at the next significant swing low, with an invalidation level at the recent swing high. Traders should monitor for any signs of reversal or divergence that could alter this outlook.\n---\n\nLook at the updated chart image above. Has anything materially changed that would alter your analysis? Consider: new signals fired, price broke key levels, RSI divergence shifted, pattern invalidated, or volume profile changed.\n\nIf your analysis is still valid, respond with EXACTLY:\nUNCHANGED\n\nIf anything has changed, provide a complete updated analysis with these sections:\n1. **Pattern Recognition**\n2. **Signal Confidence** (1-10)\n3. **Key Price Levels**\n4. **Expected Move** (target + invalidation)\n5. **Risk Assessment**\n\nBe specific with price levels and dates. Keep it concise and actionable.\n\nIf providing an updated analysis, also include the JSON overlay block at the end (same format as the original request).\n\nBefore finalizing your response, compare the `Current Close` to your `target_price` and `invalidation_price` using a 0.5% tolerance. If the target is already met or the invalidation triggered, state this explicitly in the analysis (e.g., 'Target Achieved on YYYY-MM-DD at PRICE' or 'Invalidated on YYYY-MM-DD at PRICE') and adjust Signal Confidence and next-action guidance accordingly.\n\nAdditionally, at the END of your response, include a structured JSON block wrapped in ```json ... ``` code fences with this exact schema:\n```json\n{\n  \"support_levels\": [price1, price2],\n  \"resistance_levels\": [price1, price2],\n  \"direction\": \"BULLISH\",\n  \"pattern\": {\n    \"name\": \"Pattern Name\",\n    \"points\": [\n      {\"date\": \"YYYY-MM-DD\", \"price\": 123.45, \"role\": \"upper\"},\n      {\"date\": \"YYYY-MM-DD\", \"price\": 100.00, \"role\": \"lower\"}\n    ]\n  },\n  \"target_price\": 123.45,\n  \"invalidation_price\": 100.00\n}\n```\nJSON rules:\n- support_levels: 1-3 most important support prices visible on the chart\n- resistance_levels: 1-3 most important resistance prices visible on the chart\n- direction: \"BULLISH\" or \"BEARISH\" \u2014 your directional bias based on the analysis\n- pattern.name: The chart pattern identified \u2014 ONLY linear-boundary patterns that can be drawn with straight trendlines:\n  ALLOWED: Ascending Triangle, Descending Triangle, Symmetrical Triangle, Rising Wedge, Falling Wedge, Bull Flag, Bear Flag, Channel Up, Channel Down, Head & Shoulders, Inverse Head & Shoulders, Double Top, Double Bottom\n  NOT ALLOWED (set pattern to null instead): Cup & Handle, Rounding Bottom, Rounding Top, Saucer, or any pattern requiring curved lines. Describe these in the text analysis but mention the pattern overlay cannot be drawn for this pattern type due to its curved nature.\n- pattern.points: 3-6 key boundary vertices that outline the pattern shape (NOT individual price swings). Each point has:\n  - \"date\": YYYY-MM-DD format\n  - \"price\": numeric price at that vertex\n  - \"role\": either \"upper\" (upper trendline/boundary) or \"lower\" (lower trendline/boundary)\n  For channels/triangles/wedges: place 2-3 points on the upper trendline and 2-3 on the lower trendline. Upper points should form one straight line, lower points another.\n  For bull flag / bear flag: The flag is the CONSOLIDATION zone only (NOT the flagpole). Place 2 upper points along the top edge of the consolidation (recent swing highs within the flag) and 2 lower points along the bottom edge (recent swing lows within the flag). These should form two roughly parallel, slightly sloping lines. Do NOT use the flagpole base or tip as flag boundary points.\n  For head & shoulders: mark the left shoulder peak, head peak, right shoulder peak (upper), and the two neckline points (lower).\n  For double top/bottom: mark the two peaks (upper) and the valley/neckline (lower), or vice versa.\n  IMPORTANT: Each boundary (upper and lower) needs at least 2 points to draw a trendline. Never leave a boundary with only 1 point.\n  Points should be in chronological order.\n- target_price: Your projected target price (numeric). MUST be above current close for BULLISH, below for BEARISH.\n- invalidation_price: Price level that invalidates the thesis (numeric). MUST be below current close for BULLISH, above for BEARISH.\n- All prices MUST be numeric (no strings). All dates MUST be YYYY-MM-DD format.\n- CRITICAL: For pattern points, you MUST use dates and prices ONLY from the \"Swing Highs\" and \"Swing Lows\" lists provided in the context data. Use swing highs for \"upper\" role points and swing lows for \"lower\" role points. Do NOT estimate prices from the chart image.\n- For support_levels, use prices from the Swing Lows list. For resistance_levels, use prices from the Swing Highs list.\n- If no clear pattern exists, or the pattern requires curved lines (cup & handle, rounding bottom, etc.), set pattern to null.\n- IMPORTANT: In your text response, NEVER mention \"JSON\", \"null\", \"set to null\", or any implementation details. If a pattern cannot be overlaid, simply say the pattern overlay cannot be drawn for this pattern type due to its curved nature.",
