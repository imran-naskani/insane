    "response": "**1. Pattern Recognition:**\nThe chart appears to be forming a potential **descending triangle** pattern. This pattern starts around December 2025, with a series of lower highs and a relatively flat support level around $410. The pattern is currently in the late stage, approaching the apex.\n\n**2. Signal Confidence:**\nConfidence Level: **6/10**\n\n- **Supporting Factors:** The recent Turn_Up (LONG) signal aligns with a bounce off the support level around $410. The profit factor of 2.47 suggests favorable risk-reward.\n- **Undermining Factors:** The RSI levels (46.3 and 44.9) are below 50, indicating bearish momentum. The close is below the momentum trend line, suggesting caution.\n\n**3. Key Price Levels:**\n\n- **Support:** $410 (recent bounce level)\n- **Resistance:** $430 (recent highs and upper boundary of the triangle)\n\n**4. Expected Move:**\nGiven the descending triangle pattern and current momentum, a potential breakout is likely. If the price breaks below $410, a move towards $390 could occur. Conversely, a break above $430 could target $450.\n\n- **Target Price:** $390 (bearish scenario) or $450 (bullish scenario)\n- **Invalidation Level:** A close above $430 would invalidate the bearish outlook.\n\n**5. Risk Assessment:**\nWatch for any divergence between price and RSI, as this could signal a reversal. Additionally, a significant increase in volume on a breakout would confirm the move. The current RSI levels suggest caution, as they indicate weak momentum."
