Describe where the pattern starts and its current stage.\n\n2. **Signal Confidence**: Rate your confidence (1-10) in the most recent trading signal. Explain what supports or undermines it (volume, RSI divergence, momentum alignment).\n\n3. **Key Price Levels**: Identify the most important support and resistance levels visible on the chart. Include approximate price values.\n\n4. **Expected Move**: Based on the trend, momentum, and pattern context, what is the most probable next move? Include a target price and an invalidation level.\n\n5. **Risk Assessment**: Any warning signs or divergences that traders should watch for?\n\nBe specific with price levels and dates where visible.

    "response": "1. **Pattern Recognition**: The chart is forming an \"Ascending Channel.\" The pattern starts around 2025-08-20 and is currently in an upward phase.\n\n2. **Signal Confidence**: Confidence level is 8. The recent LONG signal is supported by the close being above the momentum trend line and RSI levels indicating bullish momentum without being overbought.\n\n3. **Key Price Levels**:\n   - **Support**: 221.23, 171.26\n   - **Resistance**: 296.5, 221.23\n\n4. **Expected Move**: The most probable next move is upward, targeting a price of 320.00. Invalidation occurs if the price falls below 221.23.\n\n5. **Risk Assessment**: Watch for any RSI divergence or a break below the momentum trend line, which could signal weakening momentum.",
