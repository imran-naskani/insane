    "response": "**1. Pattern Recognition:**\nThe chart appears to be forming an ascending channel starting from around November 2025. The price is currently near the upper boundary of this channel, indicating a potential continuation or a pullback.\n\n**2. Signal Confidence:**\nConfidence Level: 8/10\n- The current close is above the momentum trend line, supporting the recent LONG signal.\n- RSI levels (9 and 14) are moderately high but not overbought, suggesting room for further upward movement.\n- Volume is steady, supporting the upward trend.\n\n**3. Key Price Levels:**\n- **Support:** Around 260, where the ATR trailing stop levels are visible.\n- **Resistance:** Approximately 290, near the recent highs.\n\n**4. Expected Move:**\nThe most probable next move is a continuation of the upward trend towards the resistance level of 290. If the price breaks above this level, the next target could be around 310. An invalidation level would be a close below the support at 260.\n\n**5. Risk Assessment:**\n- Watch for any bearish divergence in RSI, which could indicate weakening momentum.\n- A significant increase in volume on a down day could signal a potential reversal.\n- Keep an eye on the price action near the resistance level for any signs of rejection."
