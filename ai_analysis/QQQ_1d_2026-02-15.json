Describe where the pattern starts and its current stage.\n\n2. **Signal Confidence**: Rate your confidence (1-10) in the most recent trading signal. Explain what supports or undermines it (volume, RSI divergence, momentum alignment).\n\n3. **Key Price Levels**: Identify the most important support and resistance levels visible on the chart. Include approximate price values.\n\n4. **Expected Move**: Based on the trend, momentum, and pattern context, what is the most probable next move? Include a target price and an invalidation level.\n\n5. **Risk Assessment**: Any warning signs or divergences that traders should watch for?\n\nBe specific with price levels and dates where visible.

MUST be above current close for BULLISH, below for BEARISH.\n- invalidation_price: Price level that invalidates the thesis (numeric). MUST be below current close for BULLISH, above for BEARISH.\n- All prices MUST be numeric (no strings). All dates MUST be YYYY-MM-DD format.\n- CRITICAL: For pattern points, you MUST use dates and prices ONLY from the \"Swing Highs\" and \"Swing Lows\" lists provided in the context data. Use swing highs for \"upper\" role points and swing lows for \"lower\" role points. Do NOT estimate prices from the chart image.\n- For support_levels, use prices from the Swing Lows list. For resistance_levels, use prices from the Swing Highs list.\n- If no clear pattern exists, set pattern to null.",
